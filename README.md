# BlueStorm
An Open Source Python Tool for Bluetooth Jamming (Work in Progress)

## Overview
BlueStorm is a research-oriented tool designed for experimenting with Bluetooth signals. It has successfully jammed Bluetooth speakers, but it is currently not effective against more advanced devices like AirPods or other high-security Bluetooth peripherals.

> **Note:** This project is for educational and research purposes only. Misuse of this tool for illegal activities is strictly discouraged and not supported.

## How Bluetooth Works
Bluetooth operates on the 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz radio frequency, a band shared by Wi-Fi, microwave ovens, and other wireless devices. To minimize interference, Bluetooth uses frequency hopping—constantly shifting frequencies—to maintain uninterrupted data transmission.

### Key Points:
- Bluetooth devices must pair before communication, usually with a passcode.
- Communication range is typically up to 10 meters.
- Frequency hopping makes data interception more difficult.

## Bluetooth Security Risks
While generally secure, Bluetooth is vulnerable to certain attacks:
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers intercept data between devices using fake Bluetooth signals.
- **Bluejacking:** Sending unsolicited messages to a device, which can be used to spam or install malware.
- **Bluesnarfing:** Gaining unauthorized access to device files.

## Bluetooth Security Tips
- Turn off Bluetooth when not in use to avoid unauthorized connections.
- Use Bluetooth security solutions to safeguard your device.
- Be aware of potential risks and mitigate them by using secure devices and practices.

## Common Applications of Bluetooth
- Wireless audio devices: Headphones, speakers
- Input devices: Keyboards, mice
- Car kits, printers, file transfers
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices

## Malicious Bluetooth Attacks
AirPods and similar high-security devices block repeated requests to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. When detecting multiple requests from a device, AirPods:
1. Ignore repeated requests.
2. Block the device if the behavior persists.

## AirPods Defense Mechanism
AirPods implement rate limiting and packet filtering:
- **Rate Limiting:** Restricts the number of requests a device can send within a specific timeframe.
- **Packet Filtering:** Analyzes network traffic and blocks duplicate packets from the same device to avoid flooding attacks.

## Attack Detection and Prevention
These security features help maintain performance and stability by blocking malicious traffic. However, attackers may try to bypass these mechanisms using:
- **Fragmentation Attacks:** Splitting packets to evade rate limits.
- **Spoofing Source Addresses:** Sending packets with fake addresses.
- **Flooding Attacks:** Overloading the device with numerous packets.
- **Protocol Tunneling:** Using non-Bluetooth protocols over the Bluetooth connection.

## Bypassing Bluetooth Security
Advanced techniques to bypass Bluetooth security may involve exploiting vulnerabilities or generating MAC addresses with specific Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI). Below is an example Python script to generate a MAC address with a given OUI.

```python
import random

TARGET_OUI = "00:50:C2"

def generate_mac_address(oui):
    # Generate the last 3 bytes of the MAC address
    last_bytes = [random.randint(0x00, 0xff) for _ in range(3)]
    # Concatenate the OUI and the last 3 bytes to form the MAC address
    mac_address = oui + ":" + ":".join('{:02x}'.format(byte) for byte in last_bytes)
    return mac_address

# Generate a MAC address with the specified OUI
mac_with_oui = generate_mac_address(TARGET_OUI)
print(mac_with_oui)
```

## Conclusion
BlueStorm is an ongoing research project aimed at understanding the security mechanisms of Bluetooth devices. While it has been successful in specific cases, challenges remain in bypassing the protections of high-security devices like AirPods. Always ensure to use this tool responsibly and within legal boundaries.
